I first extracted the year , month and day from the date and created independent 3 variables out of it.
Then I implemented the leave one out encoding on the 3 categorical variables i.e State, Market category and Product category
Then I predicted the target values using regression decision tree.
This prediction was not perfect
Then I used regression for each of the leaves of the decision tree.
The regression was for the: grade, demand, high_cap_price, year, month, day, demand*grade, demand*high_cap_price 
Then modified the prediction.

I have fine tuned the decision tree for its no. of splits using a cross validation subset
